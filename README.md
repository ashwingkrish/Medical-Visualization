# Retina data-visualization

This is a project developed during a Zeiss hackathon that performs the following operations:
* Uses an image of a retina, taken by the ZEISS CLARUS 500. This image is called Fundus.png in this project.
* Uses data collected by a Humphrey Field Analyser. This file is called "Humpherey data.pdf"
* Detects the blind spot on the eye
* Maps data obtained from the Humphrey Field Analyser, and maps it onto the Fundus image

The actual process is demonstrated in the notebook- accurate_mapping.ipynb

And to just get the final mapped image, just run the zeiss.py file by typing:


```python3 zeiss.py```


This is useful for analysis of people suffering from glaucoma.
